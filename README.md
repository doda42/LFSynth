# Quick start
Requires the Light Field Toolbox for MATLAB available here: https://roboticimaging.org/Tools/LFToolbox

Run DemoLFSynth.m. It should generate a light field in a few seconds, and display it using the interactive LFDispMousePan function.

For further information please see the header comments in DemoLFSynth.m.
